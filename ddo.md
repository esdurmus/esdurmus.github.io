This corpus consists of collection of 78,376 debates from October 2007 until November 2017 drawn from <a href="http://www.debate.org/">debate.org</a> 
along with comprehensive information about 45,348 users who have participated in debates either as a debater or as an 
audience (i.e. by voting or commenting).

<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xZw7OUl1nD5CihWubxsqGxyoVhj0a-5k?usp=sharing">DDO dataset</a> is described in detail in [1] and [2].
To recreate the dataset, you'll need to download the
following two files:<br>

<ul> <li> <b>debates.json:</b> This JSON file contains a Python dictionary that assigns a 
<i>debate name</i> --- a unique name for each debate --- to comprehensive information about that debate.  <br> <li> <b>users.json:</b> This JSON file includes a Python dictionary representation of each user in the dataset. <br> This dataset includes very comprehensive information about the debates and the users. For more information about the content of the dataset and how to use it, please refer to the <b>readme</b> file. <br><br>
