abstract = {Debate is a process that gives individuals the opportunity to express, and to be exposed
to, diverging viewpoints on controversial issues; and the existence of online debating
platforms makes it easier for individuals to participate in debates and obtain feedback
on their debating skills. But understanding the factors that contribute to a user's
success in debate is complicated: while success depends, in part, on the characteristics
of the language they employ, it is also important to account for the degree to which
their beliefs and personal traits are compatible with that of the audience. Friendships
and previous interactions among users on the platform may further influence success.
In this work, we aim to better understand the mechanisms behind success in online
debates. In particular, we study the relative effects of debaters' language, their
prior beliefs and personal traits, and their social interactions with other users.
We find, perhaps surprisingly, that characteristics of users' social interactions
play the most important role in determining their success in debates although the
best predictive performance is achieved by combining social interaction features with
features that encode information on language use during the debate.},
